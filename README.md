# Microsoft's enter to movie industry: creating strategy
## Three questions to answer in this analysis
1. Which genre of a movie should Microsoft create?
1. What is the size of the budget required and the expected revenue size?
1. Who should be the director of the movie to maximize gross revenue and rating?

## Finding & Recommendations
- Horror genres has the highest expected ROI (revenue / budget size) among the top 10 most popular genres.
- The average ROI of horror movie is on the increase in the past 20 years, likely a result of increasing consumer preference to this genre. Both of the facts make horror movie genre very attractive for new entrants which have to build their capability from scratch.
- While 75 percentile of budget and revenue for horro movie creator is roughly \\$20MM and \\$110MM each, Microsoft, with large resources to deploy, should have 100+ percentile figures. We propose Microsoft spends $50MM and expects $300MM in revenue at minimum.

## Limitation and next step
- We merged some of the tables by titles. Although we tried our best to clean the data (by removing spaces and making titles lower-case so that we have more match), but this needs to be further improved.
- This analysis solely focused on the market condition and not internal capability of Microsoft, which should be taken into consideration when making the decision.
